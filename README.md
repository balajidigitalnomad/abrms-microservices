# 📌 Project Overview

ABRMS (Akshaya Bhavan Restaurant Management System) is a production-oriented enterprise Spring Boot Microservices project developed using a Gradle Multi-Module architecture. The project demonstrates how modern distributed systems are built using Spring Cloud components, service discovery, API gateway, synchronous and asynchronous communication, and enterprise design patterns.

This project has been designed to provide hands-on implementation of real-world microservices architecture following industry best practices.

# 📡 Event-Driven Architecture

The User Service publishes business events whenever a new user is created.

### Flow

```
User Created
      │
      ▼
Kafka Producer
      │
      ▼
user-events Topic
      │
      ▼
Kafka Consumer
```

---

# 🔄 Application Flow

1. Client sends a request to the API Gateway.
2. API Gateway routes the request to the appropriate microservice.
3. User Service processes the request.
4. User information is stored in MySQL.
5. User Service publishes a **UserCreatedEvent** to Kafka.
6. Kafka Broker stores the event in the **user-events** topic.
7. Kafka Consumer receives and processes the event asynchronously.
